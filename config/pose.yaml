# MMA Pose Estimation Configuration
# Configure pose model and keypoint extraction parameters

pose:
  # Pose model path
  model_path: "yolo11x-pose.pt"

  # Model type: yolo, rtmpose, vitpose
  model_type: "yolo"

  # Keypoint confidence threshold
  keypoint_conf_threshold: 0.3

  # Bounding box padding
  bbox_padding: 0.0

  # GPU device
  device: "cuda"

  # Batch size for inference
  batch_size: 16

# Alternative configurations
# RTMPose (more accurate, slower)
# pose:

#   keypoint_conf_threshold: 0.4
#   batch_size: 8

# ViTPose (transformer-based, high accuracy)
# pose:
#   model_path: "vitpose-base"
#   model_type: "vitpose"
#   keypoint_conf_threshold: 0.3
#   batch_size: 4
